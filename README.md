## Description
Budget Tracker is an easy to use web application that allows you to keep track of additions to and subtractions from your account. The app provides line items for each transaction, and there is a graph of account changes at the bottom.

Additionally, the app has offline functionality, so any items added while offline or with poor internet connection will be uploaded once a good connection is re-established.

Finally, the app functions as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It can be installed on a mobile device or computer as a standalone app.
